## MathString class!
The Mathstring class contains one public static function, and many private static functions for its inner working. The public function 'eval(String equation)' takes a string, and attempts to evaluate it as a math equation. The only acceptable characters in the string are +, -, \*, /, ^, (, ), numbers, decimal points, and white space.
